ðŸ“Š Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project analyzes **Superstore sales data (2019â€“2020)** using **Power BI**.
The company experienced **rising sales but stagnant profits** and wanted to understand where revenue was leaking, how customers were behaving, and how future sales could be forecasted for better planning.

The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into **actionable insights** to support business decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Business Objectives

The management wanted answers to three key questions:

1. **Which product categories and products are truly profitable, not just high in sales?**
2. **Which regions or states are underperforming and need business focus?**
3. **How are customers purchasing, and what do future sales look like?**

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

* Source: Kaggle Superstore Sales Dataset
* Time Period: **2019â€“2020**
* Key Fields: Sales, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category, Region, State, Segment, Payment Mode, Shipping Mode, Order Date

ðŸ”¹ Key Visuals & Insights

 1. KPI Overview

* **Total Sales:** \$1.57M
* **Total Profit:** \$175K
* **Quantity Sold:** 22K units
* **Avg Delivery Time:** 4 days

2. Category & Product Analysis

* **Sales vs Profit by Category (Combo Chart):**

  * Technology â†’ Highest sales, but weaker profit margins.
  * Office Supplies â†’ Lower sales, but stronger margins.
  * Furniture â†’ Moderate in both.
* **Sales by Sub-Category:** Phones and Chairs dominated revenue, while several categories underperformed.

3. Regional & State Analysis

* **Sales by Region:**

  * West (33%) and East (28%) were top performers.
  * South underperformed significantly.
* **Sales & Profit by State:**

  * California and New York led both sales and profit.
  * Several southern states were weak contributors.

 4. Customer & Behavior Analysis

* **Sales by Segment:**

  * Consumer segment drove \~48% of sales.
  * Corporate and Home Office followed.
* **Sales by Payment Mode:**

  * Digital transactions dominated (Online 35%, Card 22%).
  * Cash on Delivery (43%) remained significant, indicating potential efficiency issues.


 5. Trend & Forecasting

* **Monthly Sales vs Profit YoY:**

  * Sales grew in 2020 vs 2019.
  * Profit growth was inconsistent, suggesting discounting or rising costs.
* **60-Day Sales Forecast:**

  * Projected steady growth with slight seasonal dips.
  * Provides management foresight for inventory and promotional planning.

ðŸ”¹ Problems Identified (as a Data Analyst)

From the analysis, several key problems became clear:

1. **Profitability mismatch** â†’ Categories like Technology generated high revenue but low margins, reducing overall profitability.
2. **Regional imbalance** â†’ West and East regions dominated, while South consistently underperformed.
3. **Customer behavior shift** â†’ COD payments still accounted for 22%, increasing costs and risks, despite digital adoption rising.
4. **Inconsistent profit trends** â†’ Despite sales growth, profit did not rise proportionally, signaling discounting or cost inefficiencies.
5. **Future uncertainty** â†’ Without forecasting, inventory and campaign planning risked being reactive instead of proactive.

ðŸ”¹ Recommendations

To address these problems, I recommend the following actions:

1. **Optimize pricing & discount policies** for low-margin, high-sales categories like Technology.
2. **Promote high-margin categories** (Office Supplies) through targeted campaigns to improve profitability.
3. **Focus marketing strategies** on the South region to balance geographical performance.
4. **Encourage digital payments** with incentives to reduce reliance on COD.
5. **Leverage forecasting** insights to plan inventory and seasonal promotions in advance.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Techniques

* **Power BI Desktop** â†’ Data visualization & dashboarding
* **Power Query** â†’ Data cleaning and transformation
* **DAX Measures** â†’ Profit Margin %, YoY growth
* **Forecasting** â†’ Power BI time-series model

 ðŸ”¹ Final Takeaway

This dashboard gave management a **360Â° view** of their business by showing:

* **What happened** (past performance: sales, profit, regions, customers)
* **Why it happened** (profit leaks, regional imbalances, payment behavior)
* **What will happen next** (60-day forecast for sales)

As a data analyst, I identified profitability gaps, regional weaknesses, and customer behavior shifts â€” and recommended **pricing optimization, targeted regional marketing, digital adoption, and forecast-based planning**.
